My current clinic has v16.1 of Eclipse whereas the scripts were built in v15.6 (during my residency). This may cause a bit of a mismatch between the code and what Eclipse requires. Both scripts will run in v16.1
as they were recompiled with the necessary libraries to run in v16.1. The VMS.TPS libraries have been updated to v16.1. Minimal changes were required for the plug-in script.
However, the executable binary is now compiled and placed in /ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/bin/x64/debug instead of /ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT/bin/debug
You need to modify the .ini configuration file inside the /bin/x64/debug directory for any changes to take effect if your clinic is using v16. 

I will work to update the scripts using build configurations so it is easy to rebuild the scripts according to the Eclipse version at your clinic.

Latest code versions:
Plug-in --> v1.7_beta
Executable --> v1.2_beta

Updates to both scripts from v1.5/v1.0 (i.e., pre- 11/12/2021):
-Fixed minor bugs and GUI formatting issues in both codes
-Added code to allow the user to specify default settings in both scripts in a .ini configuration file (see the VMAT_TBI_config.ini example provided with the code)
-Provided additional options in the configuration file that the user can adjust
-Please see Section 7 of the 'VMAT_TBI_guide.pdf' file for more details on how to setup and use the configuration file

ESAPI/Projects/VMATTBIautoPlan --> binary plug in
ESAPI_MT/VMATTBI_optLoopMT --> stand-alone executable

Some important notes to make the scripts run:
binary plug-in:
-for the most part, this script is pretty self-contained
-the main parameters that can be adjusted are the global variables noted at the beginning of the UI class (UI.xaml.cs file)
-if you want to adjust the default energy for the static AP/PA beams, you need to adjust the beam energy specifier used in assigning ebmpStatic 
(two total instances of "6X" in the constructors for the class)

stand-alone executable:

Please see the VMAT_TBI_install_and_run_guide.pdf file to help you get up and running quickly. Feel free to download the example (anonymized) patient data on the master branch for some examples of running the code on real
patient data.

If you have questions, leave a comment and i'll try and respond as quickly as I can.
