The purpose of this script is to improve the efficiency and safety of planning for HDR GYN brachytherapy. The ABS and GEC-ESTRO recommends brachytherapy as an integral part of the
treatment process from GYN cancer patients. The treatment dose (external beam and brachy) should be evaluated in terms of EQD2 where the ABS recommends an EQD2 of 80-90 Gy be delivered to the
HRCTV for cervical carcinoma. In the clinics I've worked in, the dose from external beam is assumed to be uniform and equal to the prescription dose whereas the EQD2 is explicitly evaluated for each fraction of brachytherapy.
Furthermore, the achieved EQD2 for a given fraction is propagated forward for the remaining fractions to see if the ABS recommendations will be met with the given plan quality. If not, adjustments
are made to the plan and the EQD2 values are updated (rinse and repeat). The EQD2 is typically calculated by entering the DVH doses for the relevant organs (HRCTV, rectum, bladder, etc.) into a spreadsheet.
As you can imagine, this becomes tedious when multiple adjustments are made to the plan. In addition, this limits the amount of data that can be collected for research purposes (based on the time it takes 
to enter the data for each requested metric).

This script addresses these issues by automatically retriving the achieved DVH doses for the current and previously treated fractions for user-defined metrics. The achieved doses for the current fraction 
are propagated forward and the EQD2 values are evaluated and compared against user-defined tolerances. This way, you can immediately see if you are meeting the EQD2 constraints without having to enter the 
DVH doses into a spreadsheet. Once an optimal plan is achieved, the doses can be written to a spreadsheet for recordkeeping. The retrived metrics can be adjusted in the main GUI.
In addition, the metrics and the tolerances can be adjusted in a configuration file that is read upon launch. 

A second dose calculation check is included with the program and uses the point source approximation. In general, the agreement between the planned and calculated doses are within ~2%. The results of this
calculation can also be written to a text file or an excel spreadsheet.

Please see the doseStats_guide.pdf file to learn more about the code and how to get it up and running. I'll work on writing a short run and install guide (similar to the one I wrote for the VMAT TBI code).

If you have questions, leave a comment and i'll try and respond as quickly as I can.
